# Stock Analyst Recommendations

The goal of this project is to check stock analyst recommendations (bullish, bearish, or somewhere in between) from 10+ websites. 

Through the use of R, I pulled the stock recommendation of public HTML data and display it through the stock_recs() function. 

The use of this function is as easy as 1,2,3:

1) Run the code within RStudio
2) Insert the ticker within quotes in the stock_recs() function (for example: stock_recs("GOOG"))
3) Run the stock_recs() function

The result will be the publicly available stock recommendations from 12 websites.

As with any of my projects, if you find the code helpful and use or reference it within your projects, please reference me by name and github account, Angel Henriquez and @angelhenriquez1, respectively. Data analysis is a field I am passionate about and I make this code public so others may use it. The code is not meant to, and should not, be sold.

Lastly, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelhenriquez1/) if you have any questions or would like to connect.

Thanks and enjoy!
