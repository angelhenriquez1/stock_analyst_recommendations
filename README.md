# Stock Average Price Projection

The goal of this project is to identify stocks with the most profit potential. 

Stock profitability is based on the current price relative to previous maximum and minimum prices within a given time range (1 month or 3 months).

The current stock price is retrieved from Yahoo Finance; monthly and quarterly highs and lows are retrieved from Barchart.com.

I began this project for coding experience. Take any and all results with a grain of salt.

Reach out to me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelhenriquez1/) with any suggestions.

Enjoy!
