# Stock Average Price Projection

The goal of this project is to identify stocks with the most profit potential. 

Stock profitability is based on the current price relative to previous maximum and minimum prices within a given time range ([1 month](https://github.com/angelhenriquez1/stock_avg_price_projection/blob/master/1MonthProfitRange.R) or [3 months](https://github.com/angelhenriquez1/stock_avg_price_projection/blob/master/3MonthProfitRange.R)).

The current stock price is retrieved from Yahoo Finance; monthly and quarterly highs and lows are retrieved from Barchart.com.

This code is not to be sold and if replicated, changed, and/or used, please reference me by name and github account, Angel Henriquez and @angelhenriquez1, respectively.

If you have any recommendations on how to make my code more efficient or grow this idea, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelhenriquez1/).

Thanks and enjoy!
